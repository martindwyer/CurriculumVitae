# CurriculumVitae

This repository contains the code for the curriculum vitae website of Martin Dwyer.

The site contains four sections:

1.  A welcome and introduction.
2.  A condensed interactive resume including experience, education, and certificates.
3.  A portfolio page which contains several recent projects.
4.  A contact page to send messages to Martin.

The site was constructed with Gatsby.js and a variety of front-end tools.
